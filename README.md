🧾 Reseepts
Smart Finance Tracking through OCR and Predictive Insights

Reseepts is an AI-powered finance management system that automatically extracts and analyzes data from receipts using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Designed primarily for students and young professionals, the app makes expense tracking effortless and insightful — turning every receipt into financial clarity.

🚀 Features

OCR Receipt Scanning – Snap a photo of your receipt, and Reseepts automatically extracts and records key details (merchant, date, total amount).

Auto Categorization – Purchases are automatically grouped (e.g., food, transportation, utilities).

Emotion Tagging – Track how your purchases make you feel (e.g., happy, stressed, neutral).

Predictive Analytics – AI models forecast your spending trends and suggest better budgeting habits.

Raspberry Pi Integration – Optional IoT setup for receipt scanning using a Pi camera module.

Expense Dashboard – Clear visual summaries of your spending patterns and saving potential.
